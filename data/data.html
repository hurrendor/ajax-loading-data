  <h2>Visit Kenya</h2>
  <p>Think safari, think Kenya. Nestled on the coast of East Africa, Kenya is where Roosevelt, Hemingway and Churchill put romance into hunting, and started off the safari industry.</p>

<p>
<p>There are a number of parks in the east. Framed by Kilimanjaro, Amboseli is a small park with too many elephant. You'll get good sightings, but there's no longer enough meltwater coming from Kili's shrinking ice-cap to support the park's game. The situation is better in the wide expanses of Tsavo, where animals roam freely and and there aren't too many other vehicles. Shimba Hills National Park is a little gem within easy reach of Kenya's southern beach resorts, best known for its roan antelope but with cute little bushbabies who cluster round the lodge at night.</p>

<p>Head north and Nakuru is a small park around a beautiful, flamingo-filled lake: its size makes it easy to find the park rhino, but after a bit of birding it's best to move on. Aberdares is a fantastic park on the foothills of Mount Kenya, with forested slopes that get plenty of rain, but this does mean that game is harder to find. Carry on to Samburu, a beautiful - if arid - park, where you can easily find wildlife if you know where it drinks.</p>

<p>Raise your budget and you can also consider private reserves, often run in conjunction with local tribes, Hot spots include the Laikipia Plateau to the north and the Chyulu Hills west of Tsavo.</p>
